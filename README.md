# 🌙 Mirror of Heart – Divine Mood Companion

**Mirror of Heart** is an emotionally-aware spiritual AI that detects human mood via **text**, **voice**, and **images**, and responds with compassion rooted in **Islamic wisdom**. Whether you're sad, joyful, anxious, or seeking guidance, it answers like a divine confidant — blending **emotion detection**, **poetry**, **Dua**, **Quranic light**, and **machine learning** in one beautiful soul-touching conversation.

## 🧠 What It Does

Mirror of Heart uses:
- 📝 Text sentiment analysis
- 🖼️ Image-based emotion detection

to understand a user's emotional state.

It then generates soulful, tailored responses through Google's **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model using a sacred system prompt, structured as:
- **Celestial greeting**
- **Poetic empathy**
- **Quranic verses**
- **Healing Duas**
- **Gentle Islamic advice**

All wrapped in **nature metaphors**, **healing language**, and **faith-based comfort**.

## 🌟 Track Alignment

🎭 **Human-Centered AI: Empathy, Identity & Expression**  
Mirror of Heart AI is a creative collaboration between human soul and machine mind. It is:
- A tool for **emotional reflection**, not productivity.
- A design that prioritizes **tone, mood, and feeling**, not just accuracy.
- A gentle rebellion against dry automation — creating beauty and stillness through code.

It fits best in **The Creative Strand** because it uses AI to co-write soulful responses, grounded in meaning and spirit, designed to feel **uncannily human** and uniquely comforting.
